A sandwich makes a wonderfully convenient meal. However, its simplicity means that some people slap any filling between two pieces of bread and call it a day. If you want to learn how to make a better sandwich, you’ve come to the right place. Follow our top 10 tips for making sandwiches and start creating your own masterpieces.


## 1. Use Quality Ingredients
To make your own tasty sandwich, you have to start with tasty ingredients. Opting for high-quality meats, cheeses, toppings and condiments will ensure your sandwich looks and tastes its best. The next time you take a trip to the grocery store or the farmer’s market, you’ll want to pick up an array of fresh ingredients to build the ideal sandwich:

- Get your meats freshly sliced at the deli counter.
- Skip the presliced, packaged cheeses for artisan alternatives in the cheese section. The extra preparation will be worth the flavor of an aged cheddar from a local farm.
- Be sure to grab whole vegetables like tomatoes and romaine lettuce to slice up for your sandwich.
Let your tastebuds determine the best sandwich toppings and make sure they’re the best quality you can find.

## 2. Incorporate Sauces and Spreads
Once you have your quality ingredients, it’s time to consider the sauces and spreads. The right condiments will take your sandwich to a whole new level. If you’re looking for a change of pace from the condiments you typically add to your sandwiches, try making your homemade versions. Replacing your plain mayo with homemade lemon dill mayonnaise can elevate a sandwich all on its own.

Here are a few of the best sandwich condiments you might like to try:

- Chipotle mayonnaise
- Dijon mustard
- Hummus
- Tzatziki
- Fruit jam
- Pepper jelly
- Barbecue sauce
- Pesto
## 3. Remember to Add Vegetables
Sometimes your cravings can only be satisfied by a ham and cheese sandwich. When you’re considering the characteristics of a good sandwich, though, vegetables are an essential part of the puzzle. Whether you prefer a few dill pickle slices or some caramelized onion, your vegetable choices can help your sandwich taste fresher and lighter.

If you’re looking to add a new vegetable to your sandwiches, you may want to try:

- Lettuce
- Spinach
- Tomatoes
- Pickles
- Onions
- Avocado
- Sprouts
- Olives
- Peppers
- Mushrooms
- Coleslaw
## 4. Keep Proper Pairings in Mind
There’s a reason the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is such an iconic sandwich. Choosing your sandwich toppings based on how well they pair with each other ensures each bite will taste perfect. The best sandwich toppings will complement each other in both flavor and texture.

For example, a creamy brie cheese, spicy pepper jelly and cured salami sandwich tastes delicious thanks to the marriage of sweet, hot and spicy flavors. Slices of honey ham, sharp cheddar cheese and spicy whole-grain mustard on [premium wheat bread](https://www.goldmedalbakery.com/product/wheat-bread/24oz-premium-wheat-bread/) make a great-tasting arrangement.

Consider how well your sandwich ingredients work together as you compile it, and take the chance to experiment!

## 5. Get Creative With Cheese Options
There are dozens of different types of cheese to browse at the supermarket. Swapping out basic slices for a hunk of finely-aged cheese can make a significant difference in your sandwiches. If you’re looking for more choices than your local grocery store has to offer, you may want to head to a specialty cheese shop where you can sample various kinds until you find the right one for you.

- Pepper jack
- Provolone

## 6. Try Different Kinds of Bread
The right bread is the key to making a better sandwich. It’s important to select the proper sandwich bread so your sandwich can support the delicious flavors you pack inside.

Sometimes, you can find the best bread for sandwiches right in the name, like toasted [club white bread](https://www.goldmedalbakery.com/product/white-bread/club-white-bread/) for the turkey, bacon, tomato, lettuce and mayonnaise in a traditional club sandwich. However, you can also choose your bread based on your sandwich’s depth. For example, two slices of [premium Texas toast](https://www.goldmedalbakery.com/product/white-bread/texas-toast/) are thick enough to support the delicious weight of a barbecue brisket sandwich.

To find bread that tastes delicious with your ingredients, start with fresh, quality bread. Whatever your other requirements for your bread choice, you’ll want to make sure you buy it from **a quality bread maker**, so you know it’ll hold up and taste great.

## 7. Add a Little Sweetness
The beauty of a sandwich is its versatility. If you’re a fan of super savory sandwiches, try switching things up by adding a touch of sweetness to your next meal. A sweet element can make for a great sandwich when contrasted with spicy, salty flavors.

A few tasty ways to add sweetness to your sandwiches include incorporating toppings like jams, honey and fruit slices. For instance, putting apple slices on a chicken sandwich can make your sandwich taste fresher. Feel free to experiment with different additions until you get the best sweetness ratio for you.

## 8. Pile on Thinly-Sliced Meat
When you’re constructing a sandwich, opt for thinly-cut slices of meat. A thick slab of ham or turkey is generally too heavy for what’s meant to be a handheld meal. By using thin slices instead, you can enjoy the meat without compromising your sandwich’s overall composition.

Using thin-cut slices also gives you the chance to use more than one kind of meat. For example, turkey and ham are a classic combination. If you like a chicken, bacon and avocado sandwich on white bread, thinly-sliced chicken leaves you plenty of room for the rest of your delicious toppings. When you’re serving up sandwiches for a party, offering an array of thin cuts will give everyone the chance to pile their bread high with different options.

Though thick meat cuts certainly have their time and place — we’re looking at you, crispy chicken sandwich — you’re often better off going for the thinly-sliced variety.

## 9. Layer Each Item Intentionally
Yes, “sandwich science” exists, and it’s all about layering your sandwiches correctly. When planning your sandwich strategy, put some thought into your assembly. The right sandwich arrangement will ensure you experience every ingredient’s flavor and texture.

One idea for layering your sandwich components, from the bottom of the sandwich up, is:

#### 1. Slather your condiments on the bottom slice of bread.
#### 2.Add the densest vegetables, like pickles, followed by the lettuce and then the tomato.
#### 3.Add the cheese.
#### 4.Add the meat.
#### 5.Spread another layer of condiments on the top slice of bread.
This layering method is popular for a few reasons. First, the condiments act as a base for the subsequent vegetables, ensuring they don’t slide off. Second, the meat and cheese on a sandwich are usually meant to complement each other, so it makes sense to arrange them together. Finally, you’re sure to get the flavor of the condiments with the meat at the top of the sandwich.

Many people like other layering tricks — you may prefer to disperse the vegetables throughout the sandwich or place your lettuce at the top to resemble a garnish. Fortunately, you can mix and match when it comes to layering strategies. Experiment with your own ideas until you’ve developed your perfect layering technique.

## 10. Grill the Final Product
If you’ve ever enjoyed a panini, you know that there’s something special about a toasted sandwich. Give yours some extra crunch by toasting it in a pan. Simply add some butter to a hot pan or spread a little mayonnaise on the bread and toast your sandwich on either side until golden brown. Just be sure to put your cold ingredients on afterward to retain their flavor and texture!
